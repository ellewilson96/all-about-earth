## Clueless Trivia
A fun trivia application which uses a Rails API back-end to power a Javascript/React/Redux front-end. Many thanks to [jService](http://jservice.io) and [j!Archive](http://j-archive.com/)!

To start the application, you can run:

### `rake start`

Runs both [the client-side](http://localhost:3000) and [the Rails back-end](http://localhost:3001) on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Have fun!
